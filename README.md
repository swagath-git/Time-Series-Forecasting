# Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete end-to-end process of time series forecasting, including data visualization, stationarity checks, model building, and performance evaluation. The notebook provides a detailed, step-by-step approach suitable for data analysts and beginners exploring forecasting techniques.

# Key Objectives
  1. Visualize and understand time series data.
  2. Identify trends, seasonality, and random patterns.
  3. Check for stationarity using:
        Rolling Statistics
        Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
  4. Convert non-stationary data to stationary data using differencing.
  5. Plot ACF and PACF to determine ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q).
  6. Build and evaluate forecasting models for future predictions.

# Techniques & Methods Used
  1. Data Preprocessing and Visualization
  2.Stationarity Testing
  3. ARIMA Model Building
  4. Model Evaluation and Forecasting

# Tools & Libraries
  1. Python
  2. Pandas
  3. NumPy
  4. Matplotlib / Seaborn
